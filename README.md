# Clicky-Game

## Getting Started

### Programs Installed
  * React
  
First, I created a components folder and put in **Navbar.js**, **Body.js**, and **Footer.js**.  This contains of the contents of what the user will see on the screen.
  * **Navbar.js** has the title, the score and if the user is correct or incorrect in the answer the picked.
  * **Body.js** holds the images that the user can click on.
  * **Footer.js** is the end of the app and redisplays the app name.
  
There is also an **App.js** file and a folder with all the images used for the app.
  * **App.js** holds all the logic for the game.  The functions used allow the picture to picked at random and switches between the images.  It also has the functions to keep score and show the best score.
  
### Play the Game

The user will press any of the images.  They have to remember what image they pressed and click on another image.  They have to try to click all 12 images without pressing one twice.  When one image is clicked the images will immediately reshuffle.
