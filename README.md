# Clicky-Game

## Getting Started

### Programs Installed
  * React
  
First, I created a components folder and put in **Navbar.js**, **Body.js**, and **Footer.js**.  This contains of the contents of what the user will see on the screen.
  * **Navbar.js** has the title, the score and if the user is correct or incorrect in the answer the picked.
  * **Body.js** holds the images that the user can click on.
  * **Footer.js** is the end of the app and redisplays the app name.
